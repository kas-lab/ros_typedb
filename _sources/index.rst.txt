Welcome to ros_typedb's documentation!
======================================

ros_typedb provides a basic generic integration between ROS and `typeDB <https://typedb.com/>`_.
It was designed in a way to enable users to easily extend it to fulfill their
needs, its design is explained in the :doc:`design` section.

This package was tested in Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS Humble and typedb v2.24.17.

**ros_typedb is in an initial stage and under constant development**
